	httpCmd.PersistentFlags().StringP("url", "u", "http://localhost", "URL to send requests to")
	httpCmd.PersistentFlags().StringP("data", "d", `{"test": "test"}`, "Request data")
	httpCmd.PersistentFlags().StringP("proxy", "p", "", "Proxy URL")
	httpCmd.PersistentFlags().StringP("method", "m", "GET", "Method of the request (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, PATCH, HEAD)")
	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// httpCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
